# 💳 Unsupervised Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project explores anomaly detection in credit card transactions using unsupervised learning.  
Using PCA for dimensionality reduction and KMeans clustering, we identify patterns in financial data that may indicate fraudulent behavior — all without relying on labeled examples.

## 🧪 Methods Used

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- KMeans Clustering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Cluster visualization
- Unsupervised fraud detection (no labels used for training)

---

## 📁 Files Included

- `FinalProject.ipynb` — main notebook with code, visuals, and conclusions  
- `creditcard.csv` — dataset (included in ZIP, not in GitHub repo)  
- `README.txt` — this file, you're reading it :)
- `ai_attribution.txt` — acknowledgment of AI assistance

---

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Clone this repo or download the ZIP
2. (Optional) If `creditcard.csv` is missing, [download it from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook
4. Run cells in order (top to bottom)

## 🛟 Dataset Failsafe

If `creditcard.csv` fails to load:

- Download it from: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)  
- Save it in the **same directory** as `FinalProject.ipynb`  
- No preprocessing is needed
