# 💳 Unsupervised Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project explores anomaly detection in credit card transactions using unsupervised learning.  
Using PCA for dimensionality reduction and KMeans clustering, we identify patterns in financial data that may indicate fraudulent behavior — all without relying on labeled examples.

## 🧪 Methods Used

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- KMeans Clustering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Cluster visualization
- Unsupervised fraud detection (no labels used for training)

---

## 📁 Files Included

- `FinalProject.ipynb` — main notebook with code, visuals, and conclusions  
- `creditcard.csv` — dataset (included in ZIP, not in GitHub repo)  
- `README.txt` — this file, you're reading it :)
- `ai_attribution.txt` — acknowledgment of AI assistance

---

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. **Clone this repository** or download the ZIP from GitHub.
2. ⚠️ **Important:** `creditcard.csv` is *not included* in this repo due to GitHub’s 100MB file size limit.
   - [Download the dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
   - Place it in the **root directory** of this project (same folder as the notebook).
3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook** in your preferred environment.
4. Open `Final_project.ipynb` and **run all cells from top to bottom**.

## 🛟 Dataset Failsafe

If `creditcard.csv` loads correctly, you’ll see a ✅ “Success” message printed in the Jupyter notebook. Otherwise, the first code cells will raise a file-not-found warning.

To fix:

- 📥 Download the dataset from: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- 📂 Save `creditcard.csv` in the **same directory** as `Final_project.ipynb`
- 🧼 No preprocessing or renaming needed — use the file as-is from Kaggle

Once it’s in place, re-run the notebook from the top. You’re good to go!
