AI Attribution Statement

This projectâ€™s deliverable design reflects my own original ideas, design decisions, perspectives, and analysis.

ChatGPT (GPT-4) was used in the following limited, supportive roles:

    - Generating boilerplate code structure and assisting with debugging.

    - Reviewing and refining video presentation text for fluidity, spelling, and grammar.

    - Providing feedback on tone, clarity, and overall language polish.

All business analysis, unsupervised learning design choices, and project concept development are entirely my own.
